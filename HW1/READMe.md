What it is asking for is:

Implement the power2n_d(n) function using memoization (lookup table method). Memoization stores the results of expensive function calls and returns the cached result when the same inputs occur again.
In this case, the goal is to calculate

n
  efficiently by avoiding redundant calculations using a lookup table (usually implemented as a dictionary).
So, it is asking you to:

Modify the power2n_d(n) function to store previously computed values.
When power2n_d(n) is called again with the same value of n, it should use the stored (cached) result instead of recalculating from scratch.
